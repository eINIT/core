.SH NAME
tinyscheme \- A lightweight implementation of Scheme.
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBtinyscheme\fR [ \fB [ -? | -1 [ \fIfile\fB ] [ \fIargument\fB\fI ...\fB ] | -c [ \fIcommand\fB ] [ \fIargument\fB\fI ...\fB ] | \fIfile\fB\fI ...\fB ]\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBtinyscheme\fR is a small scheme interpreter that tries to keep a minimal footprint while incorporating as much of R5RS as is feasible.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-?\fR
Display command-line argument primer and exit.
.TP
\fB   [ -c \fIcommand\fB [ \fIargument\fB\fI ...\fB ] ]  \fR
Evaluate the given \fIcommand\fR, then exit. The \fIargument\fRs act as command-line arguments to the scheme expression.
.TP
\fB   [ -1 \fIfile\fB [ \fIargument\fB\fI ...\fB ] ]  \fR
Evaluate the given \fIfile\fR, then exit. The \fIargument\fRs act as command-line arguments to the scheme expression.
.SH "USAGE"
.PP
Anyone can call this binary, but ideally you'll want to use this specific scheme interpreter in other programs. To do so, you'd need to link against libtinyscheme.so. This is a more advanced topic and shall not be discussed in this manpage.
.PP
In REPL mode (calling tinyscheme without telling it to parse a file), you'll sooner or later want to exit the program. To do so, you need to use the special command \fB(quit)\fR\&.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.TP
\fBTINYSCHEMEINIT\fR
Specify your own init.scm.
.SH "FILES"
.TP
\fBinit.scm\fR
The default Initialisation file. Includes a good deal of the functionality that R5RS dictates.
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
TinySCHEME doesn't implement all of R5RS, only as much of the most useful subset as could fit in a small memory and on-disk footprint. Contact the author for bug reports; better yet: include patches. :)
