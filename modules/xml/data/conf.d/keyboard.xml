 <!-- use this file to set your console keyboard layout

      keymap is just your usual countrycode, both it and extensions are passed as-is to loadkeys
      for a complete tree of valid keymap codes, you'll have to find out where your distro keeps them.
      try /usr/share/keymaps

      like the name says, use extensions to define keymap extensions.
      you probably want to leave it like this

      if your arch is x86, then you want to leave this to 'yes', everyone else should set it to 'no'

      set unicode to 'yes' for a UTF-8 console.
      if you do set unicode to 'yes', you'll want to tell dumpkeys which character set to use for interpreting action codes, otherwise leave it blank.
      you can find valid options with "dumpkeys -h" -->

 <keyboard keymap="us" extensions="backspace keypad euro" window="yes" unicode="no" dumpkeys="" />
