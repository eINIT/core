eINIT Data Files README
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This package contains .xml/sh data files for eINIT. These files are roughly
eINIT's equivalent of /etc/init.d scripts in SysV.



INSTALLING
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's two ways you can do this, both assuming you're in the source's root in
a shell:

* configure/make:

 $ ./configure [--same-options-as-whater-you-used-for-einit]
 # make install

* w/o configure&make:

 # ./install [prefix]

(for example: "./install /" to install the new data files in your /-directory)


both ways should generate backups of your current PREFIX/etc/einit/* files if
it tries to modify them. these backups are stored in PREFIX/etc/einit/backups.
