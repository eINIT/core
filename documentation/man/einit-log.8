.SH NAME
einit-log \- retrieve log data from einit
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBeinit-log\fR [ \fB-a \fIaddress\fB\fR ] [ \fB [ -h | --help ]\fR ] [ \fB [ -f | --follow ]\fR ] [ \fB [ -r | --replay-only ]\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBeinit-log\fR is a simple command-line utility that may be used to extra log data from
a running einit core. It simply connects to einit, fetches the event log and displays it.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-a \fIaddress\fB\fR
The 9P2000 address to connect to. The default is \fBunix!/dev/einit-9p\fR\&.
.TP
\fB-h\fR
.TP
\fB--help\fR
Display help screen and exit.
.TP
\fB-r\fR
.TP
\fB--replay-only\fR
Replay the event log, then exit. This is the default behaviour.
.TP
\fB-f\fR
.TP
\fB--follow\fR
Follow the event log, that is, replay first, then stay connected and wait for updates.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.PP
Some command line options may be used to set defaults for this programme.
.TP
\fBEINIT_9P_ADDRESS=\fIaddress\fB\fR
Equivalent to the -a option. The command-line option overrides this variable.
.SH "USAGE"
.PP
The main use of this programme is to be able to retrieve notice logs and bootup messages
from einit's core. Usually this is done via \fBeinit-log>logfile\fR\&.
.PP
\fBeinit-log --follow\fR is also quite useful, since it allows trying something
and seeing immediate results in the event log. An instance of this command is usually spawned
by einit on tty11.
.SH "FILES"
.TP
\fB/dev/einit-9p\fR
The unix socket that is used (by default) for the 9p2000(.u) IPC.
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
Please send bug reports to the \fBissue tracker on einit.org\fR\&.
