.SH NAME
einit-feedback \- display feedback data from einit
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBeinit-feedback\fR [ \fB-a \fIaddress\fB\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBeinit-feedback\fR is a small curses-based helper application that is used to display
all the feedback data einit provides. It is usually run by einit on tty9, but it may be run by any member
of the einit group in any terminal they favour.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-a \fIaddress\fB\fR
The 9P2000 address to connect to. The default is \fBunix!/dev/einit-9p\fR\&.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.PP
Some command line options may be used to set defaults for this programme.
.TP
\fBEINIT_9P_ADDRESS=\fIaddress\fB\fR
Equivalent to the -a option. The command-line option overrides this variable.
.SH "USAGE"
.PP
Simply launch this programme on your favourite tty and it will replay the event log from the
core. The resulting output is the same as that on tty9, so you do not need to switch there just
to get einit feedback.
.PP
Keymap:
