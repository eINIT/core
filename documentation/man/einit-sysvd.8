.SH NAME
einit-sysvd \- SysV compatibility daemon for eINIT
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBeinit-sysvd\fR [ \fB-a \fIaddress\fB\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBeinit-sysvd\fR is a small helper daemon that translates certain sysv events into einit events.
It does so by opening /dev/initctl and whenever certain requests are received, it will open a connection to einit
and submit the appropriate commands.
.PP
In particular, you need this daemon if you want to use the 'shutdown', 'reboot', 'halt' or 'poweroff' commands,
or if you want to use the shutdown/reboot options provided in E17, GNOME, KDE, XFCE, MythTV, etc. This daemon will
also translate commands like 'init \fIrunlevel\fR\&' for einit.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-a \fIaddress\fB\fR
The 9P2000 address to connect to. The default is \fBunix!/dev/einit-9p\fR\&. This daemon will only
connect to this address when an event actually needs to be sent, and it will disconnect again right after that.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.PP
Some command line options may be used to set defaults for this programme.
.TP
\fBEINIT_9P_ADDRESS=\fIaddress\fB\fR
Equivalent to the -a option. The command-line option overrides this variable.
.SH "USAGE"
.PP
Nothing much to see here, run the programme as root and it will detach from the current terminal, write
its pidfile and then just more or less sit there waiting for a connection.
.SH "FILES"
.TP
\fB/dev/einit-9p\fR
The unix socket that is used (by default) for the 9p2000(.u) IPC.
.TP
\fB/var/run/einit-sysvd.pid\fR
This daemon will write its pid to this file.
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
Please send bug reports to the \fBissue tracker on einit.org\fR\&.

Remember that this is BETA software: avoid using this on mission-critical systems.
