 <!-- Linux CPUFreq configuration -->

<!-- below are the defaults, thus they're commented out.

 cpus="" is the number of cpus to modify, i.e. 0 to [cpus-1]
 in-switch="" is the governor to use while in a mode-switch
 post-switch="" is the governor to set in place after all switches are done

 this is one of those settings that you might want to override in modes.xml on
 a per-mode basis. -->
