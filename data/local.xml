     of kernel modules in s="" as soon as udev is up. the following example

 <services>
<!-- the following are a couple of examples for 'prefer lines'.
     using that technique, you can prefer some modules for services that are
     provided by multiple services, however, you may find it easier to just use
     a module's RID instead of a multi-call service name. for example, instead
     of specifying "displaymanager" when all you want is gdm, you may instead
     want to specify "v-gdm" in your modes.xml, whereever you keep your
     modes. alternatively, you could specify 'inderect' preferences.
     example: consider the 'logger' service, which is provided by v-metalog
     (among other modules), which also provides 'metalog' as a service. by
     specifying both 'logger' and 'metalog', you're  indirectly adding a
     prefer-line like <logger s="v-metalog" />.
     same for specifying both "logger" and "v-metalog". this latter form
     may be more reliable (since v-metalog is always unambiguous, whereas
     "metalog" might not be). -->

<!--  <prefer>
   <displaymanager s="v-kdm:v-entrance" />
   <logger s="v-metalog:v-syslog-ng:v-syslog" />
   <antivirus s="v-clamd" />
  </prefer> -->

<!-- service groups -->
<!-- NOTE! you only need to define the network-group manually if you do NOT
     wish it created by network-v2 with the devices that it actually found
     on your system -->
<!--   <network group="net-eth0" seq="all" /> -->
<!-- kern-alsa is the automatic alsa module detection... you could also specify
     the modules you need (if any) up above and remove kern-alsa -->
   <audio group="alsa:kern-alsa" seq="all" />
   <avahi group="avahi-dnsconfd" seq="all" />
<!-- add winbindd if you need it -->
   <samba group="smbd:nmbd" seq="all" />
  </alias>

  <!-- example alias: localmount is the same as mount-local -->
  <!--  <alias id="localmount" s="mount-local" /> -->

  <!-- example override: on regular systems, einit-tty will only need mount-system, but if you'd like
       to use quingy and have the terminals controlled using einit-tty, then you will need mount-critical
       if /usr is on its own partition (due to libquingy)

       please note that this example is outdated, as einit-tty is now transparent -->
  <!--  <override>
   <module id="einit-tty" requires="mount-critical" />
