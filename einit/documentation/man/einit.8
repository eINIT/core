.TH "EINIT" "8" "12 January 2007" "einit-0.15.1-svn" ""

.SH NAME
einit \- boots your computer. fast.
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBeinit\fR [ \fB-c \fIconfiguration-file\fB\fR ] [ \fB [ -h | --help ]\fR ] [ \fB-v\fR ] [ \fB [ --check-configuration | --checkup | --wtf ]\fR ] [ \fB [ --no-feedback-switch | --feedback-switch ]\fR ] [ \fB [ --sandbox | --metadaemon ]\fR ] [ \fB--override-init-check\fR ] [ \fB--ipc-command \fIcommand\fB\fR\fI ...\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBeinit\fR is a replacement for the sysv-style /sbin/init program. Just
like \fBinit\fR, it is (usually) the first program to be run by the kernel
and responsible for initialising all soft- and hardware.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB--check-configuration\fR
.TP
\fB--checkup\fR
.TP
\fB--wtf\fR
Start einit, initialise all modules and ask them to check for inconsistencies in your current
configuration, then exit. It is recommended you do this checkup after each and every modification
to your configuration file(s).
.TP
\fB-c \fIfile\fB\fR
Will make einit parse \fIfile\fR instead of /etc/einit/einit.xml.
.TP
\fB-v\fR
Display version and license strings, then exit.
.TP
\fB-h\fR
.TP
\fB--help\fR
Display help screen and exit.
.TP
\fB--ipc-command \fIcommand\fB\fR
Will start einit, initialise all modules, process \fIcommand\fR as an IPC
command, then exit. IPC output is directed to stdout. This option may be used more than once.

See einit-control(8) for a small primer on IPC commands.
.TP
\fB--feedback-switch\fR
Before switching to the first mode, switch to the "feedback"-mode to get feedback going. (This
is the default behaviour.)
.TP
\fB--no-feedback-switch\fR
Disable the switch to the "feedback"-mode
.TP
\fB--override-init-check\fR
Run in regular init-mode, even if the pid of einit is not 1. This is not recommended, as it can
mess up things badly.
.TP
\fB--sandbox\fR
Run einit in sandbox mode: tells modules not to do certain things that could mess up the current
init.
.TP
\fB--metadaemon\fR
Run einit in metadaemon mode: this is currently ignored by all modules.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.PP
There are a some environment variables that can influence einit's behaviour.
.sp
.RS
.B "Note:"
The kernel will set key=value pairs on the kernel command line as environment variables.
.RE
.TP
\fBeinit=\fIoptions\fB\fR
A comma-separated list of special option strings. These strings are colon-separated lists of atoms,
the first atom specifying what the list is about and the rest being variables. Valid strings are
"file:\fIfilename\fR[:\fIfilename\fR[...]]", which can
be used to make einit parse different configuration files than the default einit.xml, and
"mode:\fImode\fR[:\fImode\fR[...]]", which is used
to make einit switch to different modes than "default". If you specify more than parameter atom, then
these are processed in sequence. Only specified option strings change the default behaviour.

Omitting this variable is equivalent to specifying
\fBeinit=file:/etc/einit/einit.xml,mode:default\fR
.TP
\fBsoftmode=\fImode\fB\fR
Will make einit switch to the specified mode instead of "default". Provided for Gentoo compatibility.
.SH "USAGE"
.PP
This program should only be called by the kernel to initialise the system, unless you wish to use
it as a meta-daemon or to \fBcheck the configuration\fR:
.PP
\fBeinit\fR --wtf
.SH "FILES"
.TP
\fB/etc/einit/einit.xml\fR
The default configuration file. You should keep it in sync with the one provided with einit when
installing.
.TP
\fB/etc/einit/local.xml\fR
This file is (by default) included from einit.xml, you should place all your modifications in here.
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
Please send bug reports to einit's bugtracker on sourceforge.net or add them to einit's wiki.
.PP
Remember that this is BETA software: avoid using this on mission-critical systems.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBeinit\fR is pretty picky about the kernel right now: it requires proper pthreads
support (NPTL on Linux) and the default configuration files expect tmpfs and udev support. 
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fB--metadaemon\fR is not currently implemented, so it does not do anything special.
