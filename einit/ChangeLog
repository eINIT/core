2006/04/18: mdeininger
 * changes to mod_plan*
 * removed everything deptree-related
 * fixed some logics flaw
 * introduced <prefer-* /> variables: use these to express user-preferences for
   certain modules (s="rid1:rid2:...")

2006/04/15: mdeininger
 * forgot some header-files

2006/04/13: mdeininger
 * did some cleanups
 * I had an idea about getting a plan of what to load/unload laid out...
 * [utility.[ch]] some generalisation to the functions that work with null-
   terminated arrays.

2006/04/06: mdeininger
 * some changes to the STATUS-constants
 * new utility-function: cfg_getpath(): looks for a string-type variable in the
   configuration-variables and returns it adding a slash at the end if necessary
 * re-implemented mod_enable() and mod_disable() as macros.
 * new debugging-function: mod_ls_deptree()
 * better check for the filetype in mod-sysv.c and module.c

2006/04/05: mdeininger
 * new feedback module: vis-curses.c: uses curses
 * feedback modules now need enable()/disable() functions
 * some minor enhancements to vis-text.c
 * [module.[ch]] mod_enable() and mod_disable() has been put together into one
   function: mod();

2006/04/04: mdeininger
 * the sf.net guys claimed CVS was going to be back online soon, so let's resume
   hacking...
 * [utility.[ch]] refinded some functions to work with string-lists.
 * changed all references to "dpl" to "slist" as this makes more sense.
 * added another parameter to cfg_findnode(): an int that you can use to specify
   node-flags that have to be set.

2006/03/30: mdeininger
 * [module.[ch]] I renamed the next/down members of mdeptree to left/right
 * [config.h, config-xml-expat.c] been working a little on getting the
   configuration read properly.
 * [main.c] new function: switchmode(): will switch mode (~runlevel)

2006/03/29: mdeininger
 * changed a little about how the variables get defined in the config file:
   it's now <variable-name stuff= />
   seems cleaner to me

2006/03/28: mdeininger
 * whoops, the license-statement in some files was fecked up
 * [utility.[ch]] str2dpl(): converts a string to a double-pointer-array
 * [utility.[ch]] strindpl(): check if a string is in a double-pointer-array
 * [module.c] mod_create_deptree(): finding candidates now works
 * in order to work on the module-dependency-tree things, we need some example-
   modules. let's see if we can make some up...
 * new directory: src/modules/linux: linux-specific modules
 * new source-file: src/modules/linux/linux-sysconf.c: linux-specific
   system-configuration should all be put in here.
 * [config-xml-expat.c] parsing is a little... "deeper" now with the possibility
   to specify "variables" in the configuration file using the syntax <var id= />
   and any of the attributes b= s= or i= (for a boolean, string or an integer-
   value respectively)

2006/03/27: mdeininger
 * aight, let's clean up some of the more confusing things about modules...
   specifically, load()/unload() should really be enable()/disable()

2006/03/26: mdeininger
 * [module.h, vis-text.c] new member to struct mfeedback
 * changes to the configure()-function's definition, it's now being checked for
   and there is also a cleanup() function

2006/03/25: mdeininger
 * [module.c] fixed some typos
 * pthreads is now a real dependency
 * $RDYNAMIC in config.mk and configure
 * dynamic linking with back-references is a friggen bitch...!
 * [module.[ch]] new function: mod_create_deptree()
 * [utility.[ch]] new source files for utility-functions
 * [module.[ch]] new function: mod_free_deptree()

2006/03/22: mdeininger
 * I was about to work on that threading for the comment-function, but -- of
   course -- I seem to be unable to complete this today due to... interruptions..
 * first successes with a watcher-type comment-thread!

2006/03/21: mdeininger
 * [dummy.c] dummy functions
 * [module.h] new struct mfeedback {}
 * interface changes

2006/03/12: mdeininger
 * [vis-text.c] been working a little on the comment()-function
 * fixed some typos
 * fixed a bug in mod-sysv.c that caused free()'d memory to be used

2006/03/11: mdeininger
 * changed some things about variable initialisation (guess I was being stupid earlier...)
 * [config.h] some restructuring...
 * [vis-text.c] textual feedback module
 * fixed module typing
 * [config.h, config-xml-expat.c] new interface-functions
 * [config-xml-expat.c] unknown nodes will now be saved in memory

2006/03/10: mdeininger
 * [mod-sysv.c] added load() and unload() prototypes
 * renamed mod_lsmod() and mod_addmod() to mod_ls() and mod_add()
 * [module.[ch]] added the mod_load() and mod_unload() functions

2006/03/08: mdeininger
 * [module.[ch]] mod_addmod (): changed some parameters;
 * new interface for module:scanmod() functions now includes a *mod_addmod()
 * [module.c] fixes in mod_freemodules();
 * [mod-sysv.c] loads init-scripts as pseudo-modules

2006/03/08: mdeininger
 * [main.c] removed the erroneous fsync() calls.
 * [module.[ch]] has a new function: mod_lsmod()
 * [mod-sysv.c] now adheres the DEBUG-flag

2006/03/07: mdeininger
 * [default.xml] adjusted the default path for modules
 * [configure] fixed a logics-flaw (make depend, then make clean)

2006/02/28: mdeininger
 * [configure] some more magic: will define POSIX/DARWIN depending on what sys you try to run it on
   * new option --enable-sysv: it's not activated by default now...
 * [sysv.c] moved to its own directory
 * general structural changes

2006/02/23: mdeininger
 * [module.c] made some output conditional
 * [bitch.c] yes, finally some bitchin'
 * [Makefile]s make install now works properly
 * [configure] the script accepts some parameters now: --debug, --prefix and --help

2006/02/20: mdeininger
 * started on mod-sysv.c (sysv compatibility)
 * working on that module-loader...

2006/02/18: mdeininger
 * more makefile magic *g*
 * figured out how to make this thing work on macs... well, I'm still being a heretic by naming the modules
   .so even on macs but hey... who cares about filenames, really? :D
 * made a very small configure script...

2006/02/16: mdeininger
 * more work on the module loader
  (particularly on the way modules identify themselves)

2006/02/14: mdeininger
 * been working on the module-loader
 * added a file that'll contain functions for error-reporting (bitch.c, along
   with bitch.h)

2006/02/13: mdeininger
 * some work on the xml-config-parser
 * restructured the default configuration file
 * added src/modules/dummy.c

2006/02/10: mdeininger
 * initial CVS import

2006/02/08: mdeininger
 * decided not to use autoconf, automake, libtool & gettext

2006/02/07: mdeininger
 * well, i was gonna do something today, but I was distracted a lot by work,
   so progress has only been marginal

2006/02/06: mdeininger
 * started working on this
 * main.c, module.c, config-xml-expat.c, module.h, config.h
 * started by creating a default configuration
