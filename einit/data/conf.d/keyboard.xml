      you probably want to leave it like this -->

 <!-- this is the unicode section.
      set unicode= to "yes" for a UTF-8 console.
      if you do set unicode to "yes", you'll want to tell dumpkeys which character set to use
      for interpreting action codes. otherwise leave it blank.
      you can find valid options with 'dumpkeys --help' -->
