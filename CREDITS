This Software bundles Code from the following other Projects:
 * expat (MIT-style)
 * FreeBSD (3-clause BSD)

Normally we'd just go link to the appropriate libraries, but that's not
possible under all circumstances. The code bundled from FreeBSD is
needed in order to start eINIT at all, but only on FreeBSD.
Expat is bundled because it's usually installed into /usr/lib, which
would put us into a dilemma.

 > The only reason expat is bundled, is that we need to have it around
   /before/ /usr is available, which puts us in a linking dilemma.
